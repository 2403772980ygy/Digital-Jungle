# Digital-Jungle
Welcome to the Digital Jungle.

Donâ€™t get lost in the virtual jungle of the internet culture. This spring break the kids will form a band to make their own electronic instrument, produce a song and then perform with it like rock stars. They will learn basic music theory, style, rhythm, structured improvisation, sound design, electronics (hardware and software) and math. The current music world is heavily curated by Deejays that are production focused rather breaking up a system and a return to an exploration of improvisation through composition. 

-Spring2016 focused on the creative coding music through Sonic-PI
